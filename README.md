# Yondu's Yaka Arrow

This is a project to recreate the arrow and the implant from the movie guardians of the galaxy.
I am currently developing the implant.

This code listens to pin GPIO0 or D3 on a ESP8266 D1 mini and whaits until it will become low.
When it is low it will send a get request to a server and then the server can do whatever you want it to do.

The server will eventually become the arrow if i have enough time to make that.
## Roadmap

- Adding code to support an microphone for the implant

- Designing a case for the implant so it will look how it should.

- Making The Arrow
